# CloverPro
Front end for a FacilityManagerApp 

- Pull Project (git clone)

- Open the project dir in your terminal and run `npm build`

- That would pull neccessary dependencies, package it and spin off a server on port 3000

NB: CloverPro is the FrontEnd Application, so it communicates with facility-manager-api `(https://github.com/johnpaulchukwu43/facility-manager-api)`

Setup facility-manager-api to get a full working app.
